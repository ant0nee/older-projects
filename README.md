Here is a compilation of all the programs i made when i was younger. They may be broken and/or quite embarrassing but I created this just to show how I first got into programming. Some of the files have the source code lost due to their age. 

other files with lost source code that i couldn't get uploaded:

I lost the source code for snake, fibonacci, calculate the time and binomial.
